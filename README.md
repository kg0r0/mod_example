# mod_example
mod_example.c -- Apache sample example module
[Autogenerated via ``apxs -n example -g'']

To play with this sample module first compile it into a DSO file and install it into Apache's modules directory by running:
```
# yum install -y httpd
# yum install -y httpd-devel
# apxs -i -a -c mod_example.c
```
Then activate it in Apache's httpd.conf file for instance 
for the URL /example in as follows:
```
<Location "/example">
SetHandler example
</Location>
```
Then after restarting Apache via
```
# systemctl restart httpd
````
you immediately can request the URL /example and watch for the output of this module. This can be achieved for instance via:
```
# yum install -y lynx
# lynx -mime_header http://localhost/example
```
The output should be similar to the following one:
```
